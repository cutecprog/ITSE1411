<p class="p1">I started college when I was at high school. My highschool were a bad for grammer. And I have yet to take an ACC class in english. Also missed out on making focused, concised paragraphs. If only I went to a good highschool then this paragraph would be about college.
</p>
<p class="p2">I've been programming since I was a freshwoman in highschool. Started ACC programming class when I was a junior in highschool. I am now on my freshwoman year in college. I have 5 years of programming experience, most of which was not HTML/CSS (no javascript). However, I have made a website with HTML/CSS. I like cats.
</p><br />
<p class="p3">I'm taking this class to learn javascript. I'm only sort of following the subjects for each of these paragraphs becuase this is filler content. Not thriller content. Filler content. Filler content is definitely not the reason I'm taking this class.
