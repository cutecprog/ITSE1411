        Subject: Demonstration of the Preformatted Element
   ====================================================
This lesson teaches the following XHTML elements:
head
   title
      meta
         body
            comment
               paragraph
                  line break
                     division
                        heading
                           preformat
                              horizontal rule
                                 insert
                                    delete
                                       address
   ====================================================

<!-- Figure 5 -->
<p>This document demostrates the use of the line break element. Web Programmer use this elements to cause the following text to start at the behinning of the next line of the browser without ending the paragraph. This keeps the lines together. 
<br />
Sub line 1
<br />
Sub line 2
<br />
Sub line 3
</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph. Notice the white space above this paragraph. Remember, the paragraph element displays a blank white space above the text in the paragraph. 
</p>

<!-- Figure 6 -->
<p>Making document changes: The ins and del elements</p>
<p>The start tag is required and the end tag is required. <!---->
<del>Never use only one tag. </del>
Programmers use the ins and del to markup sections of the documents that have been inserted or deleted with respect to a different version of a document (e.g., in draft legislation where lawmakers need to view the changes). These two elements are unusual for XHTML in that they may serve as either block-level or inline elements<!---->
<ins> (but not both)</ins>
. They may contain on or more words within a paragraph or contain one or more block-level elements such as paragraphs, lists and tables. User agents should render inserted and deleted text in ways that make the change ovious. For instance, inserted text may appear in a special font, deleted text may not be shown at all of be shown as struck-through or with special markings.

<!-- Figure 7 -->
<p>The address Element</p>
<p>Web Programmers use the address element to supply contact information for a document or a major part of a documetn such as a form. This element often appears at the beginning or end of a document.
