<h1>Hawaiian Islands</h1>
<p class="x-large">The Hawaiian Islands, once known as the Sandwich Islands, form an archipelago of nineteen islands and atolls, numerous smaller islets, and undersea seamounts trending northwest by southeast in the North Pacific Ocean between latitudes 19° N and 29° N. The archipelago takes its name from the largest island in the group and extends some 1500 miles (2400 km) from the Island of Hawaii in the south to northernmost Kure Atoll. Excluding Midway, which is an unincorporated territory of the United States, the Hawaiian Islands form the U.S. State of Hawaii. This archipelago represents the exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, formed by volcanic activity over a hotspot in the earth's mantle. At about 3,000 km (1,860 miles) from the nearest continent, the Hawaiian Island archipelago is the most isolated grouping of islands on Earth (Macdonald, Abbott, and Peterson, 1984).

<h1>Geology</h1>
<p class="x-large">The chain of islands or archipelago formed as the Pacific plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the Earth's mantle at about 52 km (32 miles) per million years. Hence the islands in the northwest of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to erosion. The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on the southeastern island, Hawaii, and on the submerged but growing volcano at the extreme southeast, Loihi. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory of the U. S. Geological Survey documents recent volcanic activity and provides images and interpretations of the volcanism. Almost all magma created in the hotspot has the composition of basalt, and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are constructed almost entirely of this igneous rock and its coarse-grained equivalents, gabbro and diabase. A few igneous rock types with compositions unlike basalt, such as nephelinite, do occur on these islands but are extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawaii are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin. Eruptions from the Hawaii hotspot have left a trail of underwater mountains across the pacific over millions of years, called the Emperor Seamounts. Hawaii (the Big Island) is the largest and youngest island in the chain, built from five different volcanoes. Mauna Loa, comprising over half of the Big Island, is the largest shield volcano on the planet. The measurement from the base locally depressing the sea floor in the Hawaiian Trough to its peak is about 17 km (56,000 feet).

<h1>Earthquake</h1>
<p class="x-large">On Sunday, October 15, 2006 at 7:07 am local time, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7, off the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii, near the Kona /Waikoloa area of the big island in Hawaii. The initial earthquake was followed approximately five minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock. Minor-to-moderate structural damage was reported on most of the big island, with effects felt as far away as Honolulu, O'ahu, nearly 150 miles from the epicenter, including power outages which lasted for several hours on several islands including the island of Oahu and water main ruptures. The whole island of Oahu was totally out of electricity. Electricity was turned on in districts one by one. Some people didn't get their electricity until the next morning. The governor of Hawaii made a State-wide disaster declaration several hours after the earthquake struck. A tsunami alert was issued, but quickly canceled after sensor buoys failed to detect significant wave activity. Several major roadways on the big island were rendered impassable by rock slides. All airports were closed immediately following the earthquake, with most reopening within several hours in a very limited capacity. No deaths or life-threatening injuries were initially reported. On Thursday, November 23, 2006 (Thanksgiving), at approximately 9:20 AM local time, another earthquake had hit with a magnitude of around 4.5 and 5.0. The quake epicenter was near the same location as the earthquake that had hit in the previous month, on October 15. No severe damages occurred and no deaths or life-threatening injuries were reported.
